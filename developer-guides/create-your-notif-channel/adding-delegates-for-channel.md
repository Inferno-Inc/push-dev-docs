# Adding Delegates For Channel

Delegate addresses enable another address to send a notification on a channel's behalf. A channel can add (or remove) multiple delegate addresses.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Adding channel delegates is a protocol level call but the recommended way to do it is via our dApp.

{% hint style="success" %}
Delegate addresses are useful to ensure notifications can be sent out from other wallets apart from the one that created the channel. The channel creator is the only one who is able to add or remove a delegate at any time.
