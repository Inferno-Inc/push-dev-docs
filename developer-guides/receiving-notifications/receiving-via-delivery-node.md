# Receiving via Delivery Node

Push delivery nodes are a decentralized solution to enable web3 to web2 bridging. They allow any platform (whether centralized or decentralized) to receive communication from **Push storage nodes**, i.e., the nodes validating and indexing all communications and tying them to your wallet address (and multi-chain identity)

Push Delivery Nodes are currently in development and will be available to Buidlers very soon.
