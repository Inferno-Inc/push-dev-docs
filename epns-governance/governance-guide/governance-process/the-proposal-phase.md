# The Proposal Phase

The Proposal phase may be considered as the initial step towards the governance journey.

For any proposal to be accepted and executed for EPNS Governance, the initial proposer needs to submit their proposal on the [Governance Proposal](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-proposals/8) Forum with the rules mentioned below.

Note: _This is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before participating. Proposals on the forum must be submitted following a template._
{% endhint %}

### Submitting a Draft Proposals

* Users need to [follow this template](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/governance/blob/main/draft-proposal-template.md) and post a new proposal draft under [Governance Proposals](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-proposals/8).
* PUSH Champions then check the submitted draft proposal to ensure it follows the [governance rules](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/governance/blob/main/governance-rules.md). Some proposals will be asked to resubmit based on the Championsâ€™ discretion.
* Draft proposals are then promoted to the [Governance Discussions](https://gov.epns.io/c/governance-discussions/5) section provided they meet the promotion criteria mentioned below.

### What are the Promotion Criteria?

Champions will move the proposal from the Governance Proposals section to the Governance Discussion section if they meet the following criteria:

* Must follow the [Draft Proposal Template](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/governance/blob/main/draft-proposal-template.md)
* Must be submitted under [Governance Proposal](https://gov.epns.io/c/proposals-lobby/8) section
* Must be live for 5+ days
* Must have 5 Likes (minimum)

Note: _The rules of governance (meta-governance) are also the subject of governance and thus can be changed following the due process. The git repo and the forum will always reflect the latest rules as enforced and governed by the $PUSH token holders._
