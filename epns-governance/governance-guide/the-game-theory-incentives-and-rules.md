# The Game Theory, Incentives & Rules

PUSH Governance is designed keeping quality participation in mind and as a byproduct carries some incentives and penalties to keep the governance focused, active and be ever improving.

**Incentives for users whose formal draft is accepted**

* We believe that having incentives for the users whose draft proposal are accepted will greatly improve the quality of the proposal (and quantity as well ðŸ˜…) as itâ€™s in the best interest of the user to submit a draft proposal that can go through the entire cycle and be formally accepted.
* For the same, we will be creating a draft proposal soon to ask the community for the incentives they want to keep to make it happen.
* To counteract the quantity of draft proposals by a user, we have introduced rules which limit the number of draft proposals that can be submitted by the user in different phases.

**Rules for users creating a proposal draft (Proposal Phase)**

* Each user at [https://gov.epns.io](https://gov.epns.io/) is only allowed to submit a proposal draft once every 7 days under the proposal phase. Tweaks in the proposal can still be allowed at the discretion of the PUSH Champions.

**Rules for users creating a proposal draft (Snapshot Phase)**

* Each user (or PUSH Delegatee) that has the required votes delegated (75k $PUSH) is only allowed to submit a valid formal proposal on Snapshot once every 7 days.

Note: These rules fall under meta governance and thus can be changed by the voting process as defined above.
